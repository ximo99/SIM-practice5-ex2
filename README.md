# Simulation: practice 5, exercice 2.
Simulation subject within the Multimedia Engineering degree from the ETSE - Universitat de València. May 2022. Practice 5, exercise 2. Rating 7,5. The sea must be simulated on a calm day and a stormy day.

The simulation of the sea has been carried out in two situations:
- A day of good weather, that is, with the sea calm.
- A stormy day, with busy seas.

All of this has been achieved by slightly modifying the first part of the practice. In addition, after eliminating the WaveRadial and WaveGerstner classes, as they will not be used, a background image has been added.

## Project setup
The interface has also been modified:
- By pressing key 1, the user will add 5 waves with certain parameters that will cause a busy sea, as if it were a stormy day.
- By pressing key 2, the user will add 3 waves with other parameters that will cause a calmer sea.
